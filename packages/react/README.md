# React Plugin for Nx

{{what-is-nx}}

{{getting-started}}

```
? Workspace name (e.g., org name)     happyorg
? What to create in the new workspace react    [a workspace with a single React application]
? Application name                    myapp
? Default stylesheet format           CSS
```

If it's your first Nx project, the command will recommend you to install the `nx` package globally, so you can invoke `nx` directly without going through yarn or npm.

### Serving Application

- Run `nx serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
- Run `nx test myapp` to test it.
- Run `nx e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.

### Adding React Plugin Into an Existing Workspace

You can always add the React plugin to an existing workspace by installing `@nrwl/react` and then generating an React application, as follows: `nx g @nrwl/react:app myapp`.
