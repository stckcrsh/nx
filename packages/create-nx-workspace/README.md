{{what-is-nx}}

{{getting-started}}

```
? Workspace name (e.g., org name)     happyorg
? What to create in the new workspace web components    [a workspace with a single app built using web components]
? Application name                    myapp
? Default stylesheet format           CSS
```

If it's your first Nx project, the command will recommend you to install the `nx` package globally, so you can invoke `nx` directly without going through yarn or npm.

## Serving Application

- Run `nx serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
- Run `nx test myapp` to test it.
- Run `nx e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.

Angular users can also run `ng g/serve/test/e2e`.
