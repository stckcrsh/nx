# Nx and Angular CLI

Nx **is not** a replacement for Angular CLI. Under the hood, Nx uses the Angular CLI to generate code and run tasks.

When you run `nx build myapp`, Nx will invoke `ng build myapp` under the hood. When you run `nx g component mycmp`, Nx will invoke `ng g component mycmp` under the hood.

When it comes to generating code and running tasks, since `nx` delegates to `ng`, both CLIs will always produce the same result, except that running `nx` will often run a lot faster.

How?

Nx CLI uses advanced code analysis and computation caching to reuse previous computation results when possible. The Angular CLI doesn't do it. In other words, use `nx` instead of `ng`: everything will work just the same but often much faster.

The `Nx CLI` also supports a lot more commands than the Angular CLI. It can run a target against many projects in parallel, run a target against a project and its dependencies, etc..

**What does Nx add in addition to being faster?**

Here are a few tasks that are made possible by Nx.

## Using effective development practices pioneered at Google

Using Nx, you can implement monorepo-style development--an approach popularized by Google and used by many tech companies today (Facebook, Uber, Twitter, etc..).

_Doesn't Angular CLI support having multiple projects in the same workspace?_

Yes, starting with Angular CLI 6 you can add different types of projects to a single workspace (by default you can add applications and libraries). This is great, but is not sufficient to enable the monorepo-style development. Nx adds an extra layer of tooling to make this possible.

### Analyzing and Visualizing the Dependency Graph

To be able to support the monorepo-style development, the tools must know how different projects in your workspace depend on each other. Nx uses advanced code analysis to build this dependency graph. Run `nx dep-graph` to see the dependency diagram of your workspace.

### Rebuilding and Retesting What is Affected

To be productive in a monorepo, you need to be able to check that your change is safe, and rebuilding and retesting everything on every change wonâ€™t scale. Nx uses code analysis to determine what needs to be rebuilt and retested.

```bash
nx affected:build # reruns build for all the projects affected by a PR

nx affected:test # reruns unit tests for all the projects affected by a PR
```

Nx will topologically sort the projects, and will run what it can in parallel. Nx will also use its advanced distributed computation caching to drastically speed up your commands.

## Full-Stack Development

With Nx, you can build a backend application next to your frontend application in the same repository. The backend and the frontend can share code. You can connect them to enable a fantastic development experience.

_How do you do it?_

First, generate an Angular application.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:app frontend
```

Second, generate a Nest application.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/nest:app backend --frontend-project frontend # Generate a Nest Application and sets up a proxy for the frontend application.
```

## Use Innovative Tools

Tools like Cypress, Jest, Prettier, and Nest have gained a lot of popularity.

Adding these tools to the dev workflow is challenging in a regular Angular CLI project. The choice you have is not between Protractor or Cypress, but between a hacked-up setup for Cypress and a great CLI setup for Protractor. Nx changes that!

When using Nx, adding Cypress or Jest is easy:

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:app myapp --e2e-test-runner=cypress --unit-test-runner=jest # cypress and jest are actually defaults
nx g @nrwl/angular:app myapp --e2e-test-runner=protractor --unit-test-runner=karma
```

Tests can then be run just like you would run them normally:

```bash
nx test myapp
nx e2e myapp
```
